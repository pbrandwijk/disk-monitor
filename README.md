# Disk monitor

The disk monitor program is a script that prints a log of the current disk usage to 
the file ~/diskusage.log. This log file can then be used for analysis purposes.

The script optionally takes one argument. This should be a directory. The logs will 
then relate to the disk on which that directory is located.
